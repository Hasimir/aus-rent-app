# Australian Rent Application

Basic rent calculation application for people on Australian Centrelink
payments, particularly the Newstart Allowance and any of the pensions.

The purpose of this project is to provide a very basic calculation
tool for people receiving government benefits on a fortnightly basis
to be able to quickly and accurately calculate how much of their
payment they can afford to allocate towards rent; which is usually
billed monthly.

That amount is determined using the calculations of housing
organisations in Australia, such as Launch Housing and is set at 55%
of total income.  That 55% does not, however, include utilities and
other bills.
